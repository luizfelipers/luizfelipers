### My name is Luiz Felipe. I'm from Brazil :brazil: , and I'm passionate about technology :computer: and games :video_game:!

I'm currently studying at UNICAMP, seeking my Bachelor's in Informations Systems, and I love to explore new technologies and discover new skills. Since I was a child, I am totally passionate about Visual Effects (I'm a huge fan of Star Wars! âš¡), which led me into an autodidact path of exploring how things were done and discovering technologies, until I had my first contact w/ programming in High School. During College, I found the opportunity to immerse myself into the Computer Graphics area, learning from games and animations, to trending topics such as Motion Capture, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Virtual Production. Working with Computer Graphics leveraged my problem solving skills, attention to details, and systematic thinking, which helped me to get a good step towards learning Front-End and Back-End Development, as well as Data Analysis and AI knowledge I've acquired in classes and books during my academical journey. ðŸ˜„

ðŸŒ± In my spare time, I like to read, learn new things, watch video-courses, explore technologies, and besides all the technical activities, I also fancy practicing sports, staying with friends and family, watching movies, cooking, and traveling.
